* What is machine learning ?
    * Arthur Samuel (1959) - Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
    * Tom Mitchell (1998) - Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to *learn* from experience `E` with respect of task `T` and some performace measure `P`, if its performance on `T`, as measured by `P`, improves with experience `E`.
        * Spam filter:
            * T - Classifying emails as spam or not.
            * E - User marks email as spam.
            * P - The fraction of emails correctly clasified as spam/not spam.
    * Machine learning grew out of work in AI.
* Supervised learning 
    * Knows right answers.
    * Algorithm produces more right answers.
* Unsupervised Learning
